# esphome-garage-door
[ESPHome](https://esphome.io) configuration and steps used to smart enable my two garage door openers to allow control of the garage doors as well as status if the garage is open or closed.  Integration completed to [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) using API from esphome.  

# Overview
ESPHome device was built using a custom board with screw down terminals, and 4 relays built in.  Used ESPHome Docker to compile initial configuration and load onto device.  Ran 4 wire cable to leverage for run from board to sensors and for a run to each of the openers.  

I mounted my board in an enclosed electrical box that I bolted to the hanging bars of one of the openers.  Powered via a USB cable to the outlet above the opener.  Sensors were wired between both doors to allow for single 4 wire run.

The Reed sensors I used from honeywell are made for Garage Doors and allow a few inches gap which made mounting easy.  I drilled two holes in the top bar of the garage door and used machine screws to secure them to the top bar.  Then I mounted the sensor to the wall across from the magnet.

## Docker Information
Docker - esphome/esphome:dev
```docker run -d -v "/LOCAL/PATH/esphome/config:/config" --net=host esphome/esphome:dev```

## Software
- [ESPHome Flasher](https://github.com/esphome/esphome-flasher/releases) - Used to flash initial config to ESP32.  Used this utility on a Mac and it required extra drivers installed for serial to USB.
- [Drivers](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) - Installed these drivers to make the Serial port show up when connecting as USB to Mac.
